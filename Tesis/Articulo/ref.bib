  abstract = {The Moon is key to understanding both Earth and our Solar System in terms of planetary processes and has been a witness of the Solar System history for more than 4.5Ga. Building on earlier telescopic observations, our knowledge about the Moon was transformed by the wealth of information provided by Apollo and other space missions. These demonstrated the value of the Moon for understanding the fundamental processes that drive planetary formation and evolution. The Moon was understood as an inert body with its geology mainly restricted to impact and volcanism with associated tectonics, and a relative simple composition. Unlike Earth, an absence of plate tectonics has preserved a well-defined accretion and geological evolution record. However recent missions to the Moon show that this traditional view of the lunar surface is certainly an over simplification. For example, although it has long been suspected that ice might be preserved in cold traps at the lunar poles, recent results also indicate the formation and retention of OH− and H2O outside of polar regions. These volatiles are likely to be formed as a result of hydration processes operating at the lunar surface including the production of H2O and OH by solar wind protons interacting with oxygen-rich rock surfaces produced during micrometeorite impact on lunar soil particles. Moreover, on the basis of Lunar Prospector gamma-ray data, the lunar crust and underlying mantle has been found to be divided into distinct terranes that possess unique geochemical, geophysical, and geological characteristics. The concentration of heat producing elements on the nearside hemisphere of the Moon in the Procellarum KREEP Terrane has apparently led to the nearside being more volcanically active than the farside. Recent dating of basalts has shown that lunar volcanism was active for almost 3Ga, starting at about 3.9–4.0Ga and ceasing at ∼1.2Ga. A recent re-processing of the seismic data supports the presence of a partially molten layer at the base of the mantle and shows not only the presence of a 330km liquid core, but also a small solid inner core. Today, the Moon does not have a dynamo-generated magnetic field like that of the Earth. However, remnant magnetization of the lunar crust and the paleomagnetic record of some lunar samples suggest that magnetization was acquired, possibly from an intrinsic magnetic field caused by an early lunar core dynamo. In summary, the Moon is a complex differentiated planetary object and much remains to be explored and discovered, especially regarding the origin of the Moon, the history of the Earth–Moon system, and processes that have operated in the inner Solar System over the last 4.5Ga. Returning to the Moon is therefore the critical next stepping-stone to further exploration and understanding of our planetary neighborhood.}

  abstract = {This study presents high-resolution (140 m/pixel) controlled mosaics of Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) data in the lunar polar regions (80°–90° N/S), with a focus on assessing mineralogy and water content across the Artemis exploration zone. M3 extensively sampled the lunar polar regions, providing a high spatial resolution, hyperspectral imaging dataset that uniquely covers reflectance absorptions of major minerals and water on the lunar surface. We developed a methodology to preferentially use M3 image cubes acquired when the star tracker was operational to ensure accurate spatial registration of M3 pixels in our new mosaics. Integrated band depth (IBD) analyses were conducted to map distributions of hematite and other mineral species at the Artemis exploration zone. We also derived water contents at the Artemis sites from our new M3 mosaics. Our findings indicate that the Artemis exploration zone is largely dominated by mature regolith that is probably rich in plagioclase. Hematite is predominantly concentrated on east-facing slopes, likely due to enhanced oxidation from Earth wind oxygen interacting with the lunar regolith. Pyroxene-rich exposures are observed in three Artemis candidate landing regions and they are all associated with fresh impact craters. The water distribution is highly variable, with higher concentrations on pole-facing slopes and near permanently shadowed regions, likely controlled by low surface temperatures. High water contents are observed at hematite exposures, which reinforces that water may play a crucial role in hematite formation on the Moon. These results provide valuable insights for future lunar exploration, aiding in the selection of landing sites, planning of traverse routes, and informing in situ resource utilization (ISRU) for the Artemis missions.}

  abstract = {Modal analyses of 33 crystalline anorthositic fragments from Apollo 11 soil sample 10085,24 are reported. Their plagioclase contents range from ∼48 – 100 wt %, with a broad peak at about 80 wt %. These compositions contrast with those of anorthositic glass particles that are present in the soil at every landing site. The latter have a smaller range of compositions and average about 70 wt % normative plagioclase; they are chemically equivalent to anorthositic gabbros. The results of the Surveyor VII alpha-scattering experiment and the Apollo 15 X-ray fluorescence measurements indicate that the lunar highlands are more heterogenous than the anorthositic glass data indicate, and at least two regions have substantially higher Al/Si ratios (0.78 and 0.73) than the glass (0.66). These areas are thus more feldspar-rich than the glass fragments, and so are more similar to the region sampled by the Apollo 11 crystalline anorthosites. It is concluded that the fragments of crystalline anorthosites present a more realistic picture of the composition of the lunar highlands than do the glasses. Data on the relative abundances of crystalline particles and their chemically equivalent glasses in Apollo 12 and Apollo 14 soil show that glass particles are distributed over much wider areas of the Moon than are crystalline fragments. The anorthositic gabbro glass, therefore, may have been formed by a few impacts, possibly only one, that dispersed glass fragments over large areas of the lunar surface.}

  abstract = {We identified and mapped 129 mare basalt deposits in and around the South Pole–Aitken (SPA) basin, and determined absolute model ages (AMAs) for 101 of these units by performing crater size-frequency distribution (CSFD) measurements. The derived AMAs range from 2.2 Ga to 3.7 Ga, with the youngest deposits within Antoniadi crater and the oldest deposits at Jules Verne crater. Our investigations indicate a major peak in volcanic activity between 3.6 Ga and 3.2 Ga, which is a similar time range as the major volcanic activity on the nearside, and the rest of the farside. However, a second peak in volcanic activity (2.2–2.5 Ga), as observed for the nearside and parts of the farside, is not observed for the mare deposits within the SPA basin. Combining all AMAs derived for farside mare basalts reveals that volcanic activity was more abundant and lasted longer on the nearside than on the farside. We propose that the stripping of insulating crust by the large SPA-forming impact event, in combination with lower amounts of heat producing elements like Th, might be responsible for the reduced volcanic activity in the SPA basin. In addition, we estimated the thicknesses and volumes of the investigated mare deposits. With thicknesses between ∼31 m and ∼273 m and volumes of ∼1 km³ to ∼2630 km³, the mare basalt deposits in and around the SPA basin show a wide range of dimensions, similar to other mare basalts of the near- and farsides. A trend between the AMAs and the estimated volumes was not observed, but the mare deposits within the large northern craters (e.g., Apollo, Ingenii, or Leibnitz) seem to be generally larger and more voluminous than the mare basalt deposits at the center of the SPA basin.}
